# hammer-icons
My custom icons for the Hammer world editor, inspired by the [TeamSpen210's Hammer Addons](https://github.com/TeamSpen210/HammerAddons) logo. You can suggest new icons in the Issues page.

The icons come in two formats: .ico to apply the icon to Hammer, and .svg if you want to look at the horrible SVG mess generated by Figma.
